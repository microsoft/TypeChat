# MultiSchema

This application demonstrates a simple way to write a **super-app** that automatically routes user requests to child apps. 

In this example, the child apps are existing Typechat chat examples:
* CoffeeShop
* Restaurant
* Calendar
* Sentiment
* Math
* Plugins
* HealthData
* 
## Target models
Works with gpt-35-turbo and gpt-4.

Sub-apps like HealthData and Plugins work best with gpt-4
