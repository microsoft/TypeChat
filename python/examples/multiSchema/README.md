# MultiSchema

This application demonstrates a simple way to write a **super-app** that automatically routes user requests to child apps. 

In this example, the child apps are existing TypeChat chat examples:

* CoffeeShop
* Restaurant
* Calendar
* Sentiment
* Math
* Plugins
* HealthData

## Target Models

Works with GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4.

Sub-apps like HealthData and Plugins work best with GPT-4.
